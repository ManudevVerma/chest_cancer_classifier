AUGMENTATION: False              # Enable data augmentation to improve generalization
IMAGE_SIZE: (224, 224, 3)       # DenseNet121 input shape
BATCH_SIZE: 32                  # Balanced for 224x224; increase if GPU has more memory
INCLUDE_TOP: False              # We add our own classification head
EPOCHS: 10                      # 1000 is too high; DenseNet will likely converge in 30â€“80 epochs
CLASSES: 2                      # Binary classification (e.g., cancer / no cancer)
WEIGHTS: imagenet               # Use pre-trained ImageNet weights
LEARNING_RATE: 0.002           # 1e-4 is ideal for fine-tuning; 1e-6 is too small
